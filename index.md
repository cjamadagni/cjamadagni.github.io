title: About
---
Hey there! My name is Chirag Jamadagni and I am a Computer Science Master's student at [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/). Developing new applications/systems and improving existing ones gives me a thrill and I love all the challenges associated with doing so. 

Some of the stuff I've worked on can be found on my [GitHub repository](http://github.com/cjamadagni), and my resume can be found [here]({{site.url}}/public/Rohit-Varkey-Thankachan-Resume.pdf).

I completed my Bachelor's in Technology at [National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal](http://nitk.ac.in) in May 2017, and majored in Computer Engineering.

I was born and grew up in Stamford, Connecticut, and then moved to Bangalore, India for high school and undergrad. Since I am a US citizen, I don't have any visa issues and I don't require visa sponsorship to work in the US.

In my spare time I take part in sports and adventure activities. I'm an avid NBA fan and an ardent supporter of the New York Knicks. 

You can contact me by sending an email to [chirag.jamadagni@gmail.com](mailto:chirag.jamadagni@gmail.com).
