### Dynamic 3D Graph Visualizations in Julia 

A major problem with graph visualization libraries and packages is the lack of interactivity and 3D visualization. This makes understanding and analyzing complex graphs and topologies difficult. Existing packages and tools which do provide similar functionality are difficult to use, install, integrate and have many dependencies. This paper discusses Net-workViz.jl, a Julia package which addresses the issues of existing graph visualization platforms while ensuring simplicity, efficiency, a diverse set of features and easy integration with other packages. This package supports two- and three-dimensional visualizations and uses a force-directed graph drawing approach to generate aesthetically pleasing and easy-to-use graphs. The library was built entirely in Julia due to its good documentation, large open source community and in order to fully utilize the inherent advantages provided by the language. As graph visualizations are important for analyzing complex networks, testing routing algorithms, as teaching aids, etc., we believe that NetworkViz.jl will be of integral use in the fields of research and education.
